### What I learned

Honestly this challenge has some difficult parts in the hero section. This required a lot of thinking on the appropriate markup to use. This was my biggest take away from this challenge.

### Continued development

I want to continue coding different styles of landing pages. With each project completed I can feel my skills and my undestanding improving.
